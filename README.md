Introduction
============

 Rover is a file browser for the terminal.

 The main goal is to provide a faster way to explore a file system from the
terminal, compared to what's possible by using `cd`, `ls`, etc. Rover has
vi-like key bindings for navigation and can open files in $PAGER and $EDITOR.
Basic file system operations are also implemented (see rover(1) for details).
Rover is designed to be simple, fast and portable.

Requirements
============

 * Unix-like system;
 * curses library.


Configuration
=============

 Rover configuration (mostly key bindings and colors) can only be changed by
editing the file `config.h` and rebuilding the binary.

 Note that the external programs executed by some Rover commands may be changed
via the appropriate environment variables. For example, to specify an editor:
 ```
 $ VISUAL=vi rover
 ```

 Rover will first check for variables prefixed  with ROVER_. This can be used to
change Rover behavior without interfering with the global environment:
 ```
 $ ROVER_VISUAL=vi rover
 ```

 Please read rover(1) for more information.
